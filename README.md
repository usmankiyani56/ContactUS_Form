Button Component: A customizable button component that accepts props for text, icon, and outline styles. It provides flexibility in button styling for different use cases.

ContactUs Component: A simple section for displaying contact information and a brief message encouraging users to get in touch. It serves as a placeholder for contact details and introductory text on the contact page.

Form Component: This component presents a contact form where users can input their name, email, and message. It includes form validation and submission functionality, utilizing React state management for handling form data.

Navbar Component: A basic navigation bar component featuring a logo and links to different sections of the website. It provides easy navigation for users to access different pages of the application.

The App.js file serves as the entry point for the application, where these components are imported and rendered to compose the contact page. By leveraging these components, developers can quickly set up a functional contact page within their React projects, saving time and effort in development. Feel free to customize and extend these components to fit the specific requirements of your application.
